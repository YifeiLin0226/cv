  <h3>What cars am I willing to buy in the future?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>WRX: fun enough and also better than STI to drive in city</li>
    <li>Crosstrek: capable of taking me to anywhere that people normally would go under different weathers</li>
    <li>Forester, Outback, Honda Passport, ... are also great for adventuring</li>
